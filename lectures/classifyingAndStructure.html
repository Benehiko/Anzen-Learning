		seen two videos. The second video described the <font color="#800000">
		FOUR ELEMENTS </font>of information infrastructure. The introduction 
		video has already described the first of these elements: Categorization. 
		It briefly discussed categorization based on one or more of the 
		following:</font></b></p>
		<ul>
			<li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Functional </font></b></li>
			<li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Alphabetical</font></b></li>

		</ul>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">We will now discuss the second 
		element, <font color="#800000">organization</font>.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">What is organization?</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Consider the following: A newspaper 
		contains different sections, such as news, sport, arts and culture, and 
		classifieds. The <font color="#800000">categorization</font> of these 
		groups of articles or elements has already been done. Now the editor of 
		the newspaper should decide where these articles should be placed. For 
		example, most important news will be first, followed by other news. 
		Sport will be at the back and arts and culture will be added in a 
		supplement. This task is organization, or provided structure. </font>
		</b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">How does that link to 
		web sites?</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Say a company has 250 pages for its 
		web site. It will start by categorizing all those pages into categories. 
		Only them can the designer decide where on the web site these different 
		categories of pages will be displayed. The first is categorization, the 
		latter is organization.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">How do we do it?</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The method of organization depends a 
		lot on the nature of the information. The newspaper will be organized 
		according to importance of articles or perhaps the behaviour of readers. 
		Other information may be organized sequentially (as it comes). 
		Hierarchies can also be used, e.g: About Us -- &gt; Staff ---&gt; Contact 
		details. (Each staff member will have more than one piece of contact 
		information. The company will have many staff members). Hyperlinks is 
		also a great way of organizing information because it allows for easy 
		navigation. Instead of adding one piece of information before or after 
		another, this information can now be added <font color="#800000">within
		</font>another piece of information.</font></b></p>
