			The Library of Babel is a place for scholars to do research, for

			would contain every book that ever has been written, and every book 
			that ever could be - including every play, every song, every

		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">John thinks of a three-letter word. 
		Mary uses a computer programme to create every possible three 
		letter-word that can exist in English. The programme creates the 
		following words: aaa, aab, aac, aad, aae, aaf, aag, aah, aai, aaj, aak, 
		aal, aam, aan, aao, aap, aaq, aar, aas, aat, aau, aav, aaw, aax, aay, 
		aaz, aba, abb, abc, abd, abe, abf, abg, abh, abi, abj, abk, abl, abm, 
		abn, abo, abp, abq, abr and so forth. This list of the words will end 
		with zzz. Now, although Mary doesn't have any idea what John's three 
		letter word is, it will appear somewhere in this list of words. </font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, if John thinks about 3200 
		characters, those characters are bound to be in the current library of 
		babel. </font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">How does it relate to 
		this lecture?</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The amazing part about the library of 
		babel is that it will contain the every book that has ever been written. 
		The downside is that it will contain billions op pages that only consist 
		of rubbish text. Finding the text your looking for may be impossible, 
		without the search function. This is an example of valuable information 
		hidden within an overload of rubbish. It is often easy to overwhelm 
		users of your web site with too much information. Try to avoid this 
		through the mechanisms explained later in this lecture. </font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Please keep a pen and paper ready and 
		make a note at every stage where this lecture becomes boring (or if you 
		are having any other trouble with the mode of lecturing). You will be 
		provided with an opportunity to give some feedback.</font></b></p>
