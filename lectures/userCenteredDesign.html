		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">How do we do it?</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the numerous methods of 
		involving users in the design of a site's information architecture, may 
		include:</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><font color="#800000">Card sorting:</font>
		</i>In stead of the web designers categorizing the information, this 
		information can be provided to users. It can be written on cards of 
		post-it notes and given to users to sort. This may be time-consuming 
		because various users will have different categorization and 
		organization schemes, but it will provide a lot of insight into the way 
		users thinks. It also involves users in the beginning of the process.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#800000"><i>Site 
		prototyping:</i></font> Create a &quot;fake&quot; or mock-up site - the layout of 
		the site without any content. Users can then play around on the site 
		with the designers present. Users can talk through their experience with 
		the designers, highlighting issues.</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><font color="#800000">Research 
		methods such as surveys and focus groups.</font></i> A survey is a 
		written or electronic questionnaire asking users specific questions. 
		Focus groups take more time and money, but provides a lot more insight. 
		(A focus group consists of a group of 10 to 12 people answering 
		questions and having discussions about a specific topic - in this case, 
		the web site.)</font></b></p>
		<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><font color="#800000">Persona's:
		</font></i>Create a typical user. (Yes, you can even give him or her a 
		name). Now create a whole personality for this user, including his/her 
		preferences and personality. Always ask the question: Will our typical 
		user be able to use this site? </font></b></p>
